1. Building image of microservice
   $ ./mvnw -pl movie-service spring-boot:build-image -DskipTests
   $ ./mvnw -pl booking-service spring-boot:build-image -DskipTests
   $ ./mvnw -pl notification-service spring-boot:build-image -DskipTests
   $ ./mvnw -pl api-gateway spring-boot:build-image -DskipTests

2. Running services locally (cd to /deployment/docker-compose)
   $ docker compose -f infra.yml start        # Will start the databases
   $ docker compose -f services.yml start     # Will start the microservices
   --------------------------- OR ----------------------------------------------
   $ docker compose -f infra.yml -f services.yml start     # Will run one by one in same command

   (Always make sure infra.yml and services.yml are in same flow i.e at same time both are - running, stopped, added, removed)

3. Edit the hosts file in /etc/hosts and configure the movie-service and booking-service containers to point to 127.0.0.1
   when running services in docker environment.

   $ cat /etc/hosts
